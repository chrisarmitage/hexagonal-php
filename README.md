## Attempt at Hexagonal Architecture in PHP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrisarmitage/hexagonal-php.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/chrisarmitage/hexagonal-php)

This code is may cause distress in those that view it, it's an ongoing task to help me assess this design

### Current spec for the project (figured it was about time)

- Customers have a folder storing all their documents, generally in PDF
- Documents can be generated during a booking
- Documents can be generated by batch jobs
- Documents can be added in manually
- Documents can be added via a search criteria (add this document to customers WHERE...)
- Once documents have been added, an email may be sent to the customer informing them
- A list of available documents needs to be retrievable
- Documents need to be downloadable

This seems a clear example of Hexagonal Architecture.
- Customer documents can be added, removed, listed, and downloaded.
- Various unrelated parts of the code need to trigger the various events without any repeated code.
- Control is needed over how customers are notified.

Next step, start structuring it in a sensible(-ish) manner.
